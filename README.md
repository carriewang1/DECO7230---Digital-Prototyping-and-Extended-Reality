# DECO7230---Digital-Prototyping-and-Extended-Reality
This course introduces us to a range of digital prototyping techniques for generating proof-of-concept solutions for design computing projects. It primarily focuses on creating novel physical interactions using Unity3D and Arduino for domains including but not limited to extended reality and websites.

## [Prototype 1]()
Prototype I: requirements
• Interactive digital prototype using Unity (no Arduino required at this stage, but still an option). The interactive digital prototype at this stage cannot be only an Arduino sketch.
• Interaction should go beyond traditional controls (mouse, keyboard) - A use of mouse and keyboard that collects useful data is possible.
