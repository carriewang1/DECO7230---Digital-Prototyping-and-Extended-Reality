# DECO7230---Digital-Prototyping-and-Extended-Reality
This course introduces us to a range of digital prototyping techniques for generating proof-of-concept solutions for design computing projects. It primarily focuses on creating novel physical interactions using Unity3D and Arduino for domains including but not limited to extended reality and websites.

## [Prototype 1](https://github.com/carriewang1/DECO7230---Digital-Prototyping-and-Extended-Reality/tree/main/Prototype%201)

• Interactive digital prototype using Unity (no Arduino required at this stage, but still an option). The interactive digital prototype at this stage cannot be only an Arduino sketch.

• Interaction should go beyond traditional controls (mouse, keyboard) - A use of mouse and keyboard that collects useful data is possible. 

## [Prototype 2]()
• Interactive digital prototype using Unity/Arduino. This digital prototype will integrate both Arduino and Unity to create a physical interaction. Prototype II can be the next iteration of Prototype I, based on the feedback of participants from your first study. It can also explore another aspect of the general problem/challenge you are tackling.

• Reminder: Interaction should go beyond traditional controls (mouse, keyboard) - A use of mouse and keyboard that collects useful data is possible.
